## What is Hug The Line? ##

Hug The Line (HTL) is a tower defense game with a twist.  In standard tower defense games, players create deadly defenses to prevent enemy units from reaching an objective.  HTL turns this on its head by removing enemies from the equation.

Instead, players are asked to help migrating critters called Squibbles to reach their destination.  Rather than building deadly traps that hinder enemies, players will place and relocate friendly wizards that assist the Squibbles in completing their arduous journey.


## What is in this repository? ##

This repository contains project files for:

- the HTL game's proof of concept
- the tower defense API created during HTL's development
- several simple example projects that make use of the API


## What is the proof of concept? ##

Our team had an idea for a non-violent tower defense game, but would it work the way we envisioned?  More importantly, would it be fun?  Before moving the process into full-scale production, we set out to validate this vision.  The result was our proof of concept.

Over the course of 9 months, our team designed, implemented, and iterated on Hug The Line's gameplay and aesthetic.  Our focus was to create a single simple level containing the game's fundamental mechanics.

In the end, the proof of concept was considered a success.  As of this writing, Hug The Line is being developed into a full retail game.


## What's this about an API? ##

Hug The Line's programming team had two concurrent goals:

- work with the rest of our multidisciplinary team to produce the proof of concept
- design and implement an API with which others could easily make games similar to Hug The Line

The API was built on top of a rudimentary game Java engine, and the playable Hug The Line proof of concept was built using the API we created.
